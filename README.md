# MQTT-Lux-Monitoring

In this example, all needed files in order to set up a mosquitto Broker, the IoT-Gateway and the ESP32 programming, are included. To reproduce this build, use a Linux-based platform. We used a BalenaFin (alternatively RaspberryPi) as Broker and Gateway device simultaneously. ESP32 works as sensor device and ThingsBoard is used as the Cloud platform.
